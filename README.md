This projects includes:
* The proof of normalization of the Call-by-Value Simply-Typed Lambda
  Calculus (STLC) using Tait's method in Coq (with Martin Elsman).
* Implementation of nominal sets with applications to STLC (nominal
set of lambda terms, definition of alpha-equivalence, proof of
equivariance of the typing relation)
* Bi-directional type checking for STLC (with Ã‰tienne MIQUEY) - WIP.
* Intrinsically-typed System T (STLC with natural numbers). Features a denotation function on the intrinsic syntax allowing for "unquoting" syntactic expressions into Coq's definitions.
* An interpretation of the intrinsically-typed syntax of the STLC into a cartesian closed category using the Equations plugin for advanced pattern-matching on dependent types. It also features notations for "calculational proofs" similar to Lean and Agda. They allow for chaining several equational reasoning steps in an explicit manner.

Usage
-----

Requires Coq 8.11.*, depends on the Equations plugin v1.2.3+8.11 and the Categories library by Amin Timany (https://github.com/amintimany/Categories).

Use `make` to build both source file in `Stlc` folder and html.
